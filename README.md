# Product manager coding task

## Backend

I changed the backend as much as I could:

1. Added Typescript
2. Added Swagger
3. Added Logs
4. Added Tests with Vitest
5. Changed the project structure to MVC

## Frontend

I left the frontend last I think I covered all items mentioned.

1. Added the . and () search
2. Disabled the delete button when product is available
3. Show a tooltip explaining why we can't delete
4. Added the Modal Confirmation for deletion.
5. Fixed the useEffect that was not loading the products
6. Added sort by "availability"
7. Added a debouncer on the Search to avoid "too many requests"
8. Added unit test using Vitest.

## Wanted

The time was short, and I invested a good part of it in the backend.

1. Wanted to improve the UI, remove the grid since it is deprecated.
2. Add loaders
3. Improve the Search (I really don't think searching directly calling the api is the best approach)

There was more things to improve, but my day got really busy. It was fun doing it and I hope you guys enjoy what I build.
